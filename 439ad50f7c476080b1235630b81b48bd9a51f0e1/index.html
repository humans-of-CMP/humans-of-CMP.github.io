									<p>I grew up in the midst of political unrest. I’ve been interested in politics for as long as I can remember. In my lifetime, I’ve witnessed four political movements and three of them happened before I knew any anything about Jesus. The last one of them happened in November 2020 and it was called the bloody November because the government allegedly murdered 1,500 people—all of them civilians and all of them unarmed. To add insult to injury, the government usually uses all of that oppression in the name of God. I used to see God as an imaginary, bloodthirsty being who would always stand by the side of the oppressor. But I began studying apologetics and learned that Jesus actually sides with the poor, heals the sick, and hears the cries of the oppressed. I learned that he heard all the cries of the mothers who lost their sons and daughters in the protest. He felt their pain as they were shot; he was with them in the prison as they got tortured because he himself was tortured, humiliated, and killed on the cross.</p>

									<p>For me, the time in the wilderness to which the Lord invited me was not a place of lonely suffering or desert dryness. Each week, I had companions to walk alongside, and it was a time where, like finding an oasis in the dry desert, we could find rest for our souls and quench our thirst together. We've shared our strengths and weaknesses, supported each other, created beautiful melodies, and filled them with our hearts' devotion to the Lord. It has been a delight to share our hearts not only with the choir but also with the congregation.</p>

									<p>When I was 23, I had a near death experience. I got really, really sick and it completely changed where I was going in life. I was living in England at the time, but I ended up having to move back to Canada. It was really hard at the time to accept it. It's not what I wanted at the time, but in hindsight, I can definitely see how God used that. Because I moved back to Montreal, I met Luke and everything. It's always been my dream to have a family and I've always wanted to have kids. Even when I was three or four years old, I was always playing with baby dolls. Our journey was difficult. We struggled with infertility for a couple of years, so we feel so blessed that God has given us two healthy boys. It's exhausting, but it really is living the dream.</p>

									<p>If I could go back in time and speak to my 21-year-old self, I would tell myself to always be a little bit more intellectually humble. All the things that you assume you know, be a little less sure that you know them.</p>

									<p>It's important to focus on the future. We need to be moving forward as individuals and as humans. Hope is one of the greatest gifts that we have and it's what's keeping me going. I have a lot of worries for children growing up in the world, which doesn't seem to be getting much better. There's the state of world peace, if one can call it peace. There’s environmental disaster, bullying, the dangers of social media, substance abuse, and the countless other threats to a person’s wellbeing. And I get quite emotional because I tie it directly to our granddaughter who's not even five. A couple of months before my father died, he said, “Plan for the future, but take time to smell the flowers along the way.” I pray that our granddaughter and other children of her generation will grow up to lead long, happy, healthy lives. I pray that we will figure this out with God's help.</p>

									<p>There’s freedom in diversity. Whenever everybody thinks the same, you can't go out of those bounds and still belong. There are enough activities outside of the service that you get to meet people who are different—in reading groups, men’s breakfasts, and stuff like that. A couple of retreats were really good. There’s something about being out of your home and staying for prolonged periods of time. And usually it's in a nice location. You go for walks, and you get to know the kids too. One day, we went on a walk, and the whole group went. The kids were gathering stones, so I was just sitting there talking with the kids about stones, and we kept looking for more stones. And all of a sudden I realized this group had gone way up there, and they were coming back, and we were still there. The kids remember that.</p>

									<p>As a young man, I grew up in Trinidad in a culturally diverse neighbourhood, which had an incredible influence on family, religious, and community values. People are way more laid-back and island life is centred around family, friends, and community building. On the flip side, there is ongoing violence and crime in the various cities in Trinidad, which makes Canada a more ideal place to raise children. In contrast to Christopher, I was born and raised in Canada. But I have Trinidadian roots as well and come from a cultural background where food, music, and community are integral components of daily life. We met 23 years ago when Christopher sent me a dozen roses to my workplace at the time. We went out the next day for dinner and a movie and as they say, the rest was history.</p>

									<p>Family is the greatest blessing and we feel so thankful for our family of four. Janaya, our eldest, is an outgoing young lady with excellent public speaking skills, a gift that has garnered her numerous awards and accolades at school. Our son Jaylen is a caring and sensitive soul who adores building things and has developed a keen interest in cars. He often asks us what kind of car we would like to own one day, earnestly stating that he will get us a customized Bugatti. We must pray all the time and ask in the name of Jesus. Our heavenly Father will never abandon us. One of our favourite verses is Galatians 5:22-23, which encourages us to live our lives with the fruit of the Spirit. If we make an effort each day to bring a smile to someone's face, the world will become a more loving and compassionate place to live.</p>
