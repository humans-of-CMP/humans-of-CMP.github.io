									<p>I grew up in the midst of political unrest. I’ve been interested in politics for as long as I can remember. In my lifetime, I’ve witnessed four political movements and three of them happened before I knew any anything about Jesus. The last one of them happened in November 2020 and it was called the bloody November because the government allegedly murdered 1,500 people—all of them civilians and all of them unarmed. To add insult to injury, the government usually uses all of that oppression in the name of God. I used to see God as an imaginary, bloodthirsty being who would always stand by the side of the oppressor. But I began studying apologetics and learned that Jesus actually sides with the poor, heals the sick, and hears the cries of the oppressed. I learned that he heard all the cries of the mothers who lost their sons and daughters in the protest. He felt their pain as they were shot; he was with them in the prison as they got tortured because he himself was tortured, humiliated, and killed on the cross.</p>

									<p>It's important to focus on the future. We need to be moving forward as individuals and as humans. Hope is one of the greatest gifts that we have and it's what's keeping me going. I have a lot of worries for children growing up in the world, which doesn't seem to be getting much better. There's the state of world peace, if one can call it peace. There’s environmental disaster, bullying, the dangers of social media, substance abuse, and the countless other threats to a person’s wellbeing. And I get quite emotional because I tie it directly to our granddaughter who's not even five. A couple of months before my father died, he said, “Plan for the future, but take time to smell the flowers along the way.” I pray that our granddaughter and other children of her generation will grow up to lead long, happy, healthy lives. I pray that we will figure this out.</p>

									<p>For me, the time in the wilderness to which the Lord invited me was not a place of lonely suffering or desert dryness. Each week, I had companions to walk alongside, and it was a time where, like finding an oasis in the dry desert, we could find rest for our souls and quench our thirst together. We've shared our strengths and weaknesses, supported each other, created beautiful melodies, and filled them with our hearts' devotion to the Lord. It has been a delight to share our hearts not only with the choir but also with the congregation.</p>

									<p>There’s freedom in diversity. Whenever everybody thinks the same, you can't go out of those bounds and still belong. There are enough activities outside of the service that you get to meet people who are different—in reading groups, men’s breakfasts, and stuff like that. A couple of retreats were really good. There’s something about being out of your home and staying for prolonged periods of time. And usually it's in a nice location. You go for walks, and you get to know the kids too. One day, we went on a walk, and the whole group went. The kids were gathering stones, so I was just sitting there talking with the kids about stones, and we kept looking for more stones. And all of a sudden I realized this group had gone way up there, and they were coming back, and we were still there. The kids remember that.</p>
