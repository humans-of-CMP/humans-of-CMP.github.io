									<p>I grew up in the midst of political unrest. I’ve been interested in politics for as long as I can remember. In my lifetime, I’ve witnessed four political movements and three of them happened before I knew any anything about Jesus. The last one of them happened in November 2020 and it was called the bloody November because the government allegedly murdered 1,500 people—all of them civilians and all of them unarmed. To add insult to injury, the government usually uses all of that oppression in the name of God. I used to see God as an imaginary, bloodthirsty being who would always stand by the side of the oppressor. But I began studying apologetics and learned that Jesus actually sides with the poor, heals the sick, and hears the cries of the oppressed. I learned that he heard all the cries of the mothers who lost their sons and daughters in the protest. He felt their pain as they were shot; he was with them in the prison as they got tortured because he himself was tortured, humiliated, and killed on the cross.</p>

									<p>For me, the time in the wilderness to which the Lord invited me was not a place of lonely suffering or desert dryness. Each week, I had companions to walk alongside, and it was a time where, like finding an oasis in the dry desert, we could find rest for our souls and quench our thirst together. We've shared our strengths and weaknesses, supported each other, created beautiful melodies, and filled them with our hearts' devotion to the Lord. It has been a delight to share our hearts not only with the choir but also with the congregation.</p>

									<p>We come from Madagascar, a big island near the southeast coast of Africa. We were raised with mixed cultures. We are family people and we respect our elders. As the middle child and first daughter in my family, I was given a lot of responsibility, like taking care of younger siblings and helping my parents. This really shaped my personality to be more responsible and to lay on myself. This forged some of our aspirations to always help others in every way possible. Moving to Canada was a big dream for us but also a big challenge as a couple, especially when we started our own family. We were practically alone, giving birth to our son Kalo, and we were not surrounded by family unlike what we used to back in Madagascar. Here, we were by ourselves, parenting and learning everything new. However, being part of a community helped us a lot and it feels great to be part of CMP’s. We have also found again at CMP the same feeling of togetherness we once experienced as youth when we were involved in the ecumenical movement.</p>

									<p>Voici l’un des versets qui a un fort impact dans la manière qu’on vit tous les jours, c’est Jean 16:33 : “…Vous aurez des tribulations dans le monde; mais prenez courage, j'ai vaincu le monde.” We would like to share these values to our son and one day give him some guidance: “Be great in everything you do; Respect others and Trust in God.” Farany, hoy Kalo hoe: tiako be daholo ny sakafo karakarain'i Neny.</p>

									<p>I studied science in school. I was always fascinated by the creative aspect of physics. Thinking about of faraway stars and the imaginative nature of the field captivated me. I got into doing research out of school and I did research with infrared cameras for almost ten years. During this time, I developed an interest in communicating our scientific work. I bought a video camera and started interviewing colleagues about their projects. Eventually, I changed careers. I took a job making videos for high school students to help with their physics course, which led to my current work making educational videos for different companies. That career change was a major turning point in my life. I moved from being a researcher to communicating science and teaching it. I'm very, very grateful that the Lord opened doors for that project that bridged the world of research and video production. Another impactful experience was moving to Georgia for work. I had no family there and wasn’t really connecting with the church I was going to at that time. One Sunday, I saw a notice about a new church starting up in my neighbourhood. It was a very exciting experience to be a part of from the beginning stages. Initially, there was just 20 people or so and we were meeting in someone's living room. We went from that to finding a place to worship in public and invite people in. That made it possible for me to stay in Atlanta because then I had friends and family in the faith. God provided so much through that connection.</p>

									<p>I'm very grateful that I knew the Lord from a young age. As a child, the Lord was truly, and still is, my best friend. I guess as a child, when you're just developing, to know and experience the Lord so intimately as a first best friend is really cool. I think I had a pretty rich inner world that only the Lord could tap into. Even when I tried to share it with family and friends, it wasn't always possible to translate it for others. I have also struggled at times with anxiety and panic attacks. As an adult, I can put words to it and see a therapist, but when I was young, it was confusing, hard to understand, and very scary. During those times, when I was really young, I felt like I was hanging by a thread, but the Lord was holding me at the other end of that thread. Even though it seemed like a fog, I felt His presence, even if I couldn't see Him. That carried me through those difficult times. Another important person in my life is my best friend Julia. We were in our mothers’ wombs pretty much at the same time. Our mothers were best friends, and we were born almost exactly a month apart. We grew up together, celebrated holidays together, and shared countless milestones. We went to camp, got in trouble, hitchhiked, and travelled together, including probably the number one best trip ever in my life to Singapore and Indonesia at 17 or 18. Both of our mothers passed away from breast cancer and we also went through that together, losing our mothers at a young age. Julia introduced me to Ed, and she was there for the birth of Genevieve. Even though she lived in Georgia, we would call each other and have prayer walks. It’s an incredibly special and unique friendship that I just can't thank the Lord enough for.</p>

									<p>I began losing my faith nine years ago--ironically, after studying theology for a year at Durham and a psychology of religion honours class. The God I learnt about in Sunday school and thought I knew seemed nothing like the God I was studying about. Parables felt like riddles told to obscure and Jesus’ entrance to Jerusalem on a donkey instead of on foot felt like street theatre. I read up on the evolution of religions and the mechanisms underlying various religious beliefs. It was as though someone had informed me that Animal Farm was not, in fact, just a fun little story about happy talking animals. Fast forward to 2022, we moved to Montreal and one Saturday evening, found a space to have meaningful conversations with others who soon became friends. We appreciated the quiet thoughtfulness, genuine love, and diversity of people at CMP. Then, within the span of a few months, life threw us a number of curveballs: a close friend whom I’d promised to grow old with took her own life, Y’s career was nearly toppled, I had Bell’s palsy, which left me unable to work or sleep properly for three weeks, an accident in Y’s family home led to the death of a two-year-old, a mob, and my parents-in-law receiving death threats. Even though we didn’t tell people everything that was going on, our community at CMP was present on the most difficult days and supported us when we most needed the support. And for the first time in a long time, I felt God’s love and presence again.</p>

									<p>It's important to focus on the future. We need to be moving forward as individuals and as humans. Hope is one of the greatest gifts that we have and it's what's keeping me going. I have a lot of worries for children growing up in the world, which doesn't seem to be getting much better. There's the state of world peace, if one can call it peace. There’s environmental disaster, bullying, the dangers of social media, substance abuse, and the countless other threats to a person’s wellbeing. And I get quite emotional because I tie it directly to our granddaughter who's not even five. A couple of months before my father died, he said, “Plan for the future, but take time to smell the flowers along the way.” I pray that our granddaughter and other children of her generation will grow up to lead long, happy, healthy lives. I pray that we will figure this out with God's help.</p>

									<p>When I was a teen, the youth group and leaders were very impactful in my life. As a child growing up in the church, religion was very strict with a lot of emphasis on reverence. Church was very quiet and serious. But as a teen, my youth leaders were full of joy and laughter, and our Friday night youth meetings were lots of fun. Even though the leaders were serious about faith, they would play practical jokes, weird games and loved having fun. Almost 20 years later, when I was a youth leader in the same church, one of the kids in my youth group was the son of my former youth leader. He played a practical joke on me, and even though it wasn’t a big joke, it was ironic and funny to see that sense of fun and joy continued to be part of the group years later. It warmed my heart to see that we had created a space where people wanted to be, full of laughter, joy, and genuine care. Those years of ministry and faithful leaders shaped who I am today and why I do what I do.</p>

									<p>As the Youth Coordinator at CMP, it’s important that we create a space where teens can grow, be themselves, and enjoy life. Spirituality is between an individual and God; you can’t force it on someone. But you can encourage spiritual pursuit and create a positive learning environment. One of the biggest blessings of being in youth ministry is seeing life unfold after the kids graduate from high school and being able to be part of it. I've been in ministry long enough to see kids get married and then have kids themselves, and to still have relationships with them and minister to them. Having a spiritual impact on their lives, even as they are well into their own adulthood and trying to raise their kids in the Christian faith, is the biggest privilege and blessing for me.</p>

									<p>There’s freedom in diversity. Whenever everybody thinks the same, you can't go out of those bounds and still belong. There are enough activities outside of the service that you get to meet people who are different—in reading groups, men’s breakfasts, and stuff like that. A couple of retreats were really good. There’s something about being out of your home and staying for prolonged periods of time. And usually it's in a nice location. You go for walks, and you get to know the kids too. One day, we went on a walk, and the whole group went. The kids were gathering stones, so I was just sitting there talking with the kids about stones, and we kept looking for more stones. And all of a sudden I realized this group had gone way up there, and they were coming back, and we were still there. The kids remember that.</p>

									<p>As a young man, I grew up in Trinidad in a culturally diverse neighbourhood, which had an incredible influence on family, religious, and community values. People are way more laid-back and island life is centred around family, friends, and community building. On the flip side, there is ongoing violence and crime in the various cities in Trinidad, which makes Canada a more ideal place to raise children. In contrast to Christopher, I was born and raised in Canada. But I have Trinidadian roots as well and come from a cultural background where food, music, and community are integral components of daily life. We met 23 years ago when Christopher sent me a dozen roses to my workplace at the time. We went out the next day for dinner and a movie and as they say, the rest was history.</p>

									<p>Family is the greatest blessing and we feel so thankful for our family of four. Janaya, our eldest, is an outgoing young lady with excellent public speaking skills, a gift that has garnered her numerous awards and accolades at school. Our son Jaylen is a caring and sensitive soul who adores building things and has developed a keen interest in cars. He often asks us what kind of car we would like to own one day, earnestly stating that he will get us a customized Bugatti. We must pray all the time and ask in the name of Jesus. Our heavenly Father will never abandon us. One of our favourite verses is Galatians 5:22-23, which encourages us to live our lives with the fruit of the Spirit. If we make an effort each day to bring a smile to someone's face, the world will become a more loving and compassionate place to live.</p>

									<p>When I was 23, I had a near death experience. I got really, really sick and it completely changed where I was going in life. I was living in England at the time, but I ended up having to move back to Canada. It was really hard at the time to accept it. It's not what I wanted at the time, but in hindsight, I can definitely see how God used that. Because I moved back to Montreal, I met Luke and everything. It's always been my dream to have a family and I've always wanted to have kids. Even when I was three or four years old, I was always playing with baby dolls. Our journey was difficult. We struggled with infertility for a couple of years, so we feel so blessed that God has given us two healthy boys. It's exhausting, but it really is living the dream.</p>

									<p>The truth of it is that women can't do it all. There are seasons for everything. Sometimes that means putting my career on hold to focus on motherhood full-time. The first five years of being a mother was especially challenging; I'm still figuring it all out and have realized that finding a balance between career and family life is simply not realistic. When I was completing my master's degree, I had to be at peace with the fact that my kids wouldn't always have my undivided attention. It's not about being the perfect mother, its about doing the best I can. As a father of three, I don't want my sons to feel like they need to fulfill a stereotype--making lots of money to be considered a real man--in order to be happy. I want them to have the inner strength to not blindly follow trends, to have self-worth, and have knowledge of the love of God. Life will get harder than you expect but it will also become richer. Each of our sons bring so much richness to our family. Isaac is incredibly intuitive and emotionally intelligent with a knack for getting along astonishingly well with young children. Levi, who is on the spectrum, is highly intelligent and direct. He does not beat around the bush. The unique way in which he interprets his lived experiences and those around him has inspired the members of our family to slow down and live more in the moment. Finally, Zachary our youngest, is the joy bringer and resident extravert in the Favreau household. His fascination with drawing alligators is worthy of an honourable mention.</p>
